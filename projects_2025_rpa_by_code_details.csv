Project Details - MySelf Aditya, After my research toward this assignment, i found, this is the problem of OCR (OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION)                   Basically the work of OCR is to transform & extract the data from semi-structured(BILLs, INVOICES)                   or un-structured(CONTRACT, LEGAL DOCUMENTS) to structured format(CSV, EXCEL, XML, DATABASES). By this project i got idea                   about REAL-LIFE Problem, the problem of entire enterprise are data entry. Data entry is preety expensive & time consuming                   So, basically OCR creates an environment without manual data entry. 90% of stuffs can be configure by OCR & humans will only                   interrupt when accuracy is not good or some intervention is required.                   TOOLS of OCR are available in the market like- ABBYY, ROSSUM, AUTOMATION ANYWHERE, XTRACTA                   for the sake of Assignment, I did this Project with the help of CV2 (Computer Vision) and PYTESSERACT (python library                   for OCR). ''' ''' the main problem with this project is that we dont have any similar kind of format or structure, [things can be done- REGEX or ROI]  initially i was looking for regex to solve this problem, but again due to variation in every format, i can just fetch the invoice date automatically by regex. if i show you the images, we can fetch the  each given date by REGEX then store it in list, we know that invoice date will be store firstly & be the index 0. And  hence we can easily fetch 0th index element every time & append it in CSV. But the problem arrives in remains 2 that  we don't have any common starting point or end point hence we can't apply regex here......",1,Python,Python,1,4,2,0,2,1,1,0,0,"""Automation Anywhere"" in:file"

The International Construction Measurement Standards Coalition (ICMSC) is a growing group of more than 40 professional and not-for-profit organisations from around the world, working together to develop and implement international standards for benchmarking, measuring and reporting construction project cost.  About the ICMS coalition The ICMSC Standards Setting Committee comprises 27 independent experts from 17 countries. They were appointed by the coalition to draft, consult and produce the new International Construction Measurement Standards.  Find out how companies are benefitting from using ICMS  ICMS Explained ICMS Explained, a user guide for the below International Construction Measurement Standards, is a technical document that sets out the purpose, context and philosophy of ICMS. This practical resource will equip quantity surveyors and cost consultants to deliver cost estimates and financial reports in line with ICMS.  Practitioners will find the below guide valuable as a reference document to address questions of the terminology used and how ICMS rules could apply to a specific project situation.   The user guide also sets out how ICMS is used in practice by drawing on and illustrating real examples of where it is already in use.  Download the guides: ICMS User Guide: Intended for use by RICS and other relevant professionals to apply the standards. The guide provides the background, structure, content and potential use for ICMS, together with various appendices, which provide further and more detailed guidance and worked examples. Appendix A Mapping to NRM 1: This excel document maps across the NRM 1 cost groups to those which are now presented in ICMS, such that a valid interface can be achieved when comparing historic cost classification data. A PDF version of Appendix A is included in the ICMS User Guide. Appendix B Worked Examples: A selection of ‚Äòlive‚Äô projects where the presentation of the cost classification data is illustrated in a form that aligns with ICMS, and adjusted as necessary to suit local circumstances. Worked Examples include examples of projects from Turkey, Australia, and Malaysia. A PDF version of Appendix B is included in the ICMS User Guide.  ICMS Linked Excel Templates: This blank template allows practitioners to complete a cost report in accordance with the standard and with the Excel sheet formulae already embedded within. ICMS data standard Software developers and those requiring the use of structured data are advised to follow the schemas as defined, and those wishing to pursue RICS software certification must demonstrate compliance with this data standard.
